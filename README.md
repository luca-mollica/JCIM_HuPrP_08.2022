"Understanding the recognition mechanisms of a therapeutic Nanobody targeting the human prion protein using integrative structural biology data"

by Luca Mollica (UniMI) and Gabriele Giachin (UniPD).

The repositories contain the following data:

1 reference_pdb: original PDB deposited for each PrP variant plus the starting structures of each MD simulation performed (3 1 microsecond replicas for WT, E219K, V210I: the details are reported in the Materials and Methods section of the manuscript);

2 traj: complete trajectory (protein only) for each system analyzed in the manuscript (WT, E219K, V210I: the details are reported in the Materials and Methods section of the manuscript).

Due to the size of the original trajectories including water and counterions, they will be available upon request to the authors, as well as other data or scripts associated to the analysis reported in the manuscript.
